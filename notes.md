## Market Capitalization

- Market cap for short
- Found by multiplying number of outstanding shares with current stock price
- Whenever you invest in any company, you're looking for market cap to rise. The market cap only rises when stock price rises.

## Price to Earnings Ratio

- The stock price divided by the earnings per share or EPS. 
- A high P/E could mean that a stock's price is 
high relative to earnings and possibly overvalued. 
- Conversely, a low P/E might indicate that the current 
stock price is low relative to earnings meaning the company is
undervalued or doing exceptionally well compared to past trends.
